gsa-module
==========

``gsa-module`` is a Python3 package implementing several global sensitivity
analysis methods for computer/simulation experiments.
The implementation is based on a black-box approach where the computer model 
(or a generic function) is externally implemented to the module itself.
The module accepts the model outputs and the design of experiment (optional, 
only for certain methods) and compute the associated sensitivity measures.
The package also includes routines to generate normalized design of experiment 
file to be used in the simulation experiment based on several algorithms.

The general calculation flow chart involved in using the ``gsa-module`` can 
be seen in the figure below.
